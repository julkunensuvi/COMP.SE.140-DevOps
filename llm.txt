The used LLM tool was OpenAi GPT-4o model
o Motivation/reason to use LLM:  Saves time with writing the syntax parts of the code that I already understand -> I Can describe the logic and what I need the code to do in the prompt.  
o How and why LLM helped: I prefer to write helper functions, like JSON formatting etc. with an llm-model (Commented those functions on the code) -> In this case llm helped with formatting the OS processes list
o What kind of mistakes LLM did: Only tried it with few functions, Works well for simple and isolated tasks, sometimes uses old packages/functions and overly complicated code
o What were things that LLM was not able to provide: Works well with small/isolated units of code and the syntax, but I don't see a point with writing larger programs with it as it makes logical errors easily.
